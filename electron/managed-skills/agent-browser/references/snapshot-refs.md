# Snapshot and Refs

Compact element references that reduce context usage dramatically for AI agents.

**Related**: [commands.md](commands.md) for full command reference, [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) for quick start.

## How Refs Work

Traditional approach:
```
Full DOM/HTML → AI parses → CSS selector → Action (~3000-5000 tokens)
```

agent-browser approach:
```
Compact snapshot → @refs assigned → Direct interaction (~200-400 tokens)
```
